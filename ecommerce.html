            <p style="color: white; font-size: 20px;">Merged the ITEM_VOL Column & the ITEM_VOLUME Column. Upon further inspection I noticed both columns were capturing the same entries but were not aligned.
                This is likely due to the migration of historical data over to a new CRM system at the end of February.
                A unified column was created (ITEM_VOL2) ensuring that each data entry is populated with a valid value from either of the original columns
                Using the ISBLANK Formula: =IF(ISBLANK(E2), Q2, E2).
                Deleted the original ITEM_VOL Column & the ITEM_VOLUME Column as the data was now uniformly captured in the new ITEM_VOL2 Column.
